# CreditSea Offline-First User Journey & Analytics Portal

A full-stack project built for the CreditSea Full Stack Intern Challenge.  
It tracks user activity across multiple pages — including form interactions — even while offline, and syncs data to the backend once reconnected.

---

## Features

1. Track user interactions  
   - Page views  
   - Button clicks  
   - Form submissions  

2. Offline-first experience  
   - Stores events in localStorage while offline  
   - Automatically syncs to backend when back online  

3. Prevent unsynced data  
   - Warns before leaving the page if data is unsynced and user is offline  

4. Form experience  
   - Input field values (like name, email) are remembered even after refresh  
   - Restored automatically if page is revisited  
   - Data is cleared only after successful form submission  

5. Admin dashboard  
   - View all user events in real time  
   - Filtered analytics using query parameters  
   - Summary: shows counts of event types (e.g., how many clicks, submissions)
